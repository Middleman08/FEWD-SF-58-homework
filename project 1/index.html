		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="imgN/15.jpg"/>
		<p>Born in Da Nang City, Viet Nam. First and foremost (and the funniest part) I never wanted to be an architect. Ever since I was 12, I've wanted to be a biologist. I wanted to study about entomology and communicate with them. But the thing is - I liked drawing, and creating, and travelling too.</p>

		<p>In 2009, After much discussions with my parents, I decided to give architecture a go instead of biologist. </p>
		
		<p>In Viet Nam the architecture system follows the US qualification. I graduate after 5 years and then get hired by colorful house company </p>
		<p>At a University, my part time jobs is almost about the Art. I post all my project on Facebook and get hired by anybody interested with my project. My favorite kind of Art is Photorealism. From the name itself, a photorealist painting is one that looks as realistic as a photograph. This is done by taking a picture of the subject and then painting it. Photorealism is an art movement influenced by pop art, and it ran counter as a reaction to abstract expressionism.</p>
